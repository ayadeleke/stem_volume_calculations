# Setup

This project uses [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for software dependency
management. It will set up a venv in the folder `.venv` when you use the `uv`
command. For developing you need to install the `uv` tool. You can find its
documentation for installing and usage at https://docs.astral.sh/uv/.
